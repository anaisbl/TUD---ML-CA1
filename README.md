# Machine Learning - Continuous Assessment 1

## Project Overview
This project is the **final Continuous Assessment** for the course **"Machine Learning (SPEC9270)"** as part of the **Data Science program (TU059) at TU Dublin**.

### Task Description
The objective of this project is to develop a **classifier** that utilizes the provided dataset to predict the outcome of a **bank marketing campaign**.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key trends and distributions within the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Implementing various machine learning models to compare performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better predictions.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for code execution and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for training and evaluation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization tools.

### Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marketing-predictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd marketing-predictor
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the notebook to explore the analysis and results.

### Future Improvements
- Experiment with **deep learning models** for enhanced classification accuracy.
- Optimize the pipeline for **real-time predictions**.
